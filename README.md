# II-Software Engineering Frontend Tutorial Project

This is a tutorial project for the frontend part of the II-Software Engineering course.
This project is intended to be used as a reference and a starting point for the group project.

## Getting Started

First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
This will create a node_modules folder in the project root. Do not commit this folder to git!

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server on port 3000. You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.
